# Multi Trait Set Test (mtSet)

Multi Trait Set test is an implementation of efficient set test algorithms for testing for associations between multiple genetic variants and multiple traits.
mtSet can account for confounding factors such as relatedness and can be used for analysis of single traits.
A detailed description of the method can be found at [1].

## Installation

mtSet is available within the LIMIX modelling suite. 
For instruction on installation and source code we refer to: https://github.com/limix/limix.

## Tutorials

We provide iPython notebooks showcasing
- [use of mtSet from command line](mtSet_commandline.ipynb);
- [use of mtSet in python](mtSet_python.ipynb).

# Interaction set test (iSet)

Set tests are a powerful approach for association testing between groups of genetic variants and quantitative traits.
In this tutorial we showcase the usage of iSet, efficient set tests for gene-context interactions.

iSet can be applied for interaction analysis in two data designs:
* complete design, where all individuals have been phenotyped in each context
* stratified design, where each individual has been phenotyped in only one of the two contexts

A detailed description of the method can be found at [1].

## Installation

iSet is part of the mixed-model software suite LIMIX.
For instruction on installation and source code we refer to: https://github.com/limix/limix.

## Tutorials

We provide iPython notebooks showcasing
- [use of iSet from command line](iSet_commandline.ipynb);
- [use of iSet in python](iSet_python.ipynb).
